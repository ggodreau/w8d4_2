# Time Series Practice Datasets and Challenge Problem

_Compiled by Justin Pounders (GA-ATL)_

---

Welcome to another choose-your-own-adventure repo.  This time the focus is on working with time series in Python, `Pandas`, and `statsmodels`.  There are three different playgrounds, described below.

- **[Mild]** `datetime-lab`: in this lab you will be guided through a series of exercises in which you will practice using the `datetime` and `pandas` modules to manipulate dates and create time-indexed data frames.
- **[Medium]** `arima_aic_forecasting-practice`: explore Portland, OR's public transit patterns with time series modeling, complete with series decomposition, differencing, tests for stationarity and ARMA models.  You can also try out a new _super-octane_ SARIMAX model!
- **[Spicy!]** `arima-walmart-challenge`: the mild and medium samples not cutting it for ya?  You can take the training wheels off with this do-it-yourself analysis of WalMart inventory.  We provide the data and deliverables, you do _everything_ else!
